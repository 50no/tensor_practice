    As is symbolically illustrated in the cartoon, a doctor, wearing a white
gown and a stethoscope, is holding a medical record and speaking to his patient
in a hospital ward. Apparently, the meaning of the drawing is that people are doing
less and less exercises now, which is not good news for their health.
    There are numerous ways of keeping fit. First and foremost, it is most effective
to do pyhsical exercises. People variously choose jogging, playing basketball, swimming,
skating, climbing or riding as their regular exercise, because exercise never fails
to make us stronger and more energetic. Moreover, we should put great emphasis on forming
good habits. A balanced diet and sufficient sleep are both indispensable to physical
fitness. What's more, mental health should also be taken seriously. Especially in
adversity, we need to maintain an optimistic mentality to pull through life's pains
and sorrows, twists and turns.
    As far as I am conerned, I have a peculiar interest in yoga as a form of exercise.
An hour's exercise every day usually makes me feel healthier and more vigorous. Besides,
I never touch cigarettes or wines, nor do I stay up late. Instead, I keep a diet and
go to bed before 11 o'clock at night, because I believer burning the midnight oil is
harmful to health. More importantly, an optimistic attitude toward life makes me
confident and persistent. To sum up, all these practices guarantee a healthy body and
a happy life.
